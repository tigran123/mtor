# Mathematical Theory of Relativity
A classic textbook on Relativity (both Special and General) by Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington, first published in 1923.

This book is based on the source code available in Public Domain at Project Gutenberg at:
[https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59248](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59248)

I am editing this work, comparing with the later (1924) edition, as well as the Russian translation (1934), which
included some improvements, including those made for the German translation.
